;;; Commentary:

;; Provides a way to evaluate SPARQL queries in org-mode.

;;; Usage:

;; Add to your Emacs config:

;; (org-babel-do-load-languages
;;  'org-babel-load-languages
;;  '((sparql . t)))

;;; Code:
(require 'ob)
(require 'ob-comint)
(require 'ob-core)
(require 'ob-eval)
(require 'ob-ref)
(require 'sparql-mode)
(require 'url-handlers)
(require 'url-http)

(defvar org-babel-default-header-args:sparql
  `((:url . ,sparql-default-base-url)
    (:format . ,sparql-default-format))
  "Default arguments for evaluating a SPARQL query
block.")

(defun org-babel-execute:sparql (body params)
  "Execute a block containing a SPARQL query with
org-babel.  This function is called by
`org-babel-execute-src-block'. If `es-warn-on-delete-query' is
set to true, this function will also ask if the user really wants
to do that."
  (message "Executing a SPARQL query block.")
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert (sparql-execute-query (org-babel-expand-body:sparql body params)
				  t
				  (cdr (assoc :url params))
				  (cdr (assoc :format params))))

      (buffer-string)
      (if (string-equal "text/csv" url-mime-accept-string)
	  (org-babel-sparql-convert-to-table)
	(buffer-string)))))

  (org-table-convert-region (point-min) (point-max) '(4))
  (let ((table (org-table-to-lisp)))
    (cons (car table) (cons 'hline (cdr table)))))

(defun org-babel-expand-body:sparql (body params)
  "Expand BODY according to PARAMS, returning expanded body.
A variable is marked by the use of '?' or '$'; the marker is not part of
the variable name, thus '?x' and '$x' refer to the same variable."
  (org-reduce (lambda (acc pair)
            (replace-regexp-in-string
             (concat "[$?]" (regexp-quote (format "%s" (car pair)))) (cdr pair) acc))
          (mapcar #'cdr (org-babel-get-header params :var))
