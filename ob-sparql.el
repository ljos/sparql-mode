;;; Commentary:

;; Provides a way to evaluate SPARQL queries in org-mode.

;;; Usage:

;; Add to your Emacs config:

;; (org-babel-do-load-languages
;;  'org-babel-load-languages
;;  '((sparql . t)))

;;; Code:
(require 'ob)
(require 'ob-ref)
(require 'ob-comint)
(require 'ob-eval)
(require 'sparql-mode)

(defvar org-babel-default-header-args:sparql

  "Default arguments for evaluating a SPARQL query
block.")

(defun org-babel-execute:sparql (body params)
  "Execute a block containing a SPARQL query with
org-babel.  This function is called by
`org-babel-execute-src-block'. If `es-warn-on-delete-query' is
set to true, this function will also ask if the user really wants
to do that."
  (message "Executing a SPARQL query block.")
  (setq url-debug t)
